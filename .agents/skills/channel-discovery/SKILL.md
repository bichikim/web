# Channel Discovery

## Usage

Use when deciding where to spend marketing dollars and time. Ideal after defining your target market but before committing to specific tactics. Also useful when a current channel is underperforming and you need alternatives.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Inputs

Ask the user for:
1. **Target market definition** — who they're targeting (`{Identity} + {Industry} + {Business type & stage}`). Example: "B2B SaaS CTOs at seed-stage startups"
2. **Product context** — what they sell, pricing, current stage
3. **Constraints** — budget (monthly), team size, timeline, skills available
4. **Current channels** — what they've already tried and results

### Step 2: Understand the Target Market

Parse the target market definition. Identify:
- **Who they are:** Role, seniority, industry
- **How they buy:** Self-serve vs. sales-led, individual vs. committee, impulse vs. considered
- **Deal size signal:** Low-touch (< $50/mo) vs. mid-touch ($50-500/mo) vs. high-touch ($500+/mo)
- **Digital behaviour:** Where do professionals in this role/industry spend time online?

### Step 2b: Run the 12 Customer Channel Questions

Before mapping channels, get inside the customer's head. Run through these 12 questions for the target market. Answer them based on research and web searches — not assumptions.

1. **Search** — Do they use search engines? What are they searching for? What keywords or phrases?
2. **Websites** — What websites and blogs do they visit?
3. **Communities** — Which communities and groups do they hang out in (Reddit, Slack, Discord, industry forums)?
4. **Video** — What videos do they watch? Who do they subscribe to on YouTube?
5. **Social** — What social media platforms do they use? Which influencers do they follow?
6. **Email** — What email newsletters do they subscribe to?
7. **Podcasts** — What podcasts do they listen to?
8. **Professional network** — Do they have a work email address? Are they active on LinkedIn?
9. **Credentials** — Do they have specific job qualifications, certifications, or training? Are they part of professional membership bodies or associations?
10. **Events** — Do they attend trade shows, conferences, or industry meetups?
11. **Publications** — Do they read trade publications or industry news sites?
12. **Books and thought leaders** — What books do they read? Who are the thought leaders they follow?

**Diagnostic:** If the answers to these questions don't come easily, flag it — the market is probably too broad or too poorly understood. "Small businesses" can't answer these. "B2B SaaS CTOs at seed-stage startups" can. Narrow the segment before proceeding.

Channels that appear across multiple answers (e.g., LinkedIn surfaces in questions 4, 5, 8, and 9) are the strongest candidates.

### Step 3: Map Candidate Channels

Evaluate the target market against each channel category. For each, assess fit (High / Medium / Low / Skip) based on the market profile.

#### Paid Channels

| Channel | Best for | Typical B2B SaaS cost | Fit criteria |
|---------|----------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Reddit Ads** | Community-based targeting, niche B2B audiences, validation | $0.20-1.50 CPC | Audience congregates in identifiable subreddits; product benefits from cold-traffic testing |
| **Google Search Ads** | High-intent buyers actively searching for solutions | $2-15 CPC | Problem has clear search intent; people Google this problem or solution category |
| **LinkedIn Ads** | Job-title/company targeting, high-ACV B2B | $5-15 CPC | Need precise firmographic targeting; ACV justifies higher CPC; decision-makers are senior |
| **Meta Ads (Facebook/Instagram)** | Broad reach, retargeting, SMB/prosumer audiences | $0.50-3 CPC | Audience uses Facebook/Instagram personally; visual product or strong creative angle |
| **YouTube Ads** | Explainer/demo-heavy products, awareness | $0.05-0.30 CPV | Product benefits from video demonstration; audience watches industry content on YouTube |
| **X/Twitter Ads** | Tech/startup audiences, thought leadership amplification | $0.50-3 CPC | Audience is active on X; product is in tech/startup/creator space |
| **Sponsorships (newsletters, podcasts, communities)** | Niche audiences with trusted curators | $500-5000 per placement | Niche has established newsletters/podcasts; audience trusts curator recommendations |

#### Organic / Content Channels

| Channel | Best for | Time to results | Fit criteria |
|---------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **SEO / Blog content** | Search-intent capture, long-term compounding | 3-6 months | Target market Googles their problems; you can produce expert content; willing to wait |
| **Reddit organic (community engagement)** | Trust-building, validation, direct feedback | 2-4 weeks | Active subreddits exist; you can genuinely help without self-promoting |
| **LinkedIn organic** | B2B thought leadership, founder-led growth | 1-3 months | Audience is on LinkedIn; founder/team can post consistently; B2B with senior buyers |
| **X/Twitter organic** | Tech/startup community, developer audiences | 1-3 months | Audience is on X; founder has or can build a following; product is in tech space |
| **YouTube content** | Product demos, tutorials, comparison content | 3-6 months | Product benefits from visual explanation; audience searches YouTube for solutions |
| **Community building (own community)** | Retention, feedback loops, user-generated content | 3-6 months | Product has network effects or high engagement; users want to connect with each other |

#### Outbound Channels

| Channel | Best for | Time to results | Fit criteria |
|---------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Cold email** | High-ACV, targeted accounts, ABM | 2-4 weeks | Can identify and reach specific companies; ACV justifies the effort; message is relevant |
| **Cold LinkedIn outreach** | Relationship-driven B2B, senior buyers | 2-4 weeks | Decision-makers are reachable on LinkedIn; product requires trust/relationship to sell |
| **Partnerships / integrations** | Complementary products, shared audiences | 1-3 months | Clear partner ecosystem exists; mutual benefit is obvious; product integrates well |

### Step 3b: Funnel Prioritisation Check

Before investing in channels, verify the funnel can support traffic. Start from the bottom and work up:

| Funnel Stage | Health Check | Minimum Threshold |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Retention/Referral** | Do customers stay and refer? | Cohort curves must flatten (even below 10%) |
| **Activation** | Do signups experience value? | Define activation KPI (e.g., 3 actions in 5 days) |
| **Conversion (free)** | Do visitors sign up? | ≥ 10% for free tier, ≥ 4% for paid |
| **Conversion (paid)** | Do trials become customers? | ≥ 5% trial-to-paid |
| **Traffic/CPA** | Can you acquire visitors profitably? | Only focus here when above stages are healthy |

**If retention is broken:** No channel investment will help. Fix retention first.
**If conversion is below threshold:** Don't pay for traffic yet — fix the landing page, messaging, or offer.
**If activation is weak:** Fix onboarding before spending on acquisition.

### Step 3c: Extended Channel Map (19 Traction Channels)

Beyond the paid/organic/outbound categories, consider these additional traction channels:

| # | Channel | Notes |
|---|---------|-------|
| 1 | Viral marketing | Built-in sharing mechanics, referral programs |
| 2 | PR / Media | Press coverage, journalist relationships |
| 3 | Unconventional PR | Stunts, contests, viral campaigns |
| 4 | SEM (Google Ads) | Already covered in paid channels above |
| 5 | Social & display ads | Already covered above |
| 6 | Offline ads | Billboards, transit, print — niche B2B events |
| 7 | SEO | Already covered in organic channels above |
| 8 | Content marketing | Already covered above |
| 9 | Email marketing | Newsletters, sequences, lifecycle emails |
| 10 | Engineering as marketing | Free tools, calculators, browser extensions |
| 11 | Targeting blogs | Guest posts, blogger outreach |
| 12 | Business development | Strategic partnerships, integrations |
| 13 | Sales | Direct sales, inside sales |
| 14 | Affiliate programs | Commission-based referrals |
| 15 | Existing platforms | App stores, marketplaces, directories |
| 16 | Trade shows | Industry events, conferences, booths |
| 17 | Offline events | Meetups, workshops, dinners |
| 18 | Speaking engagements | Conference talks, podcasts, webinars |
| 19 | Community building | Already covered above |

Don't try all 19 — find the 1-2 that work and nail them first.

### Step 4: Research Channel Viability

For the top 3-5 candidate channels (rated High fit), do targeted research:

**For paid channels:**
- Use web search to check if competitors or similar products advertise there
- Check ad libraries (Reddit Ad Library, Meta Ad Library, LinkedIn Ad Library) for competitor presence
- Estimate budget requirements based on typical CPC and required volume

**For paid social specifically — score each platform on Concentration / Targetability / Noise:**

| Platform | Concentration | Targetability | Noise | Notes |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-------|-------|
| **LinkedIn** | ? | Excellent | High | Job title, company, seniority, skills, industry — best B2B targeting available. CPCs are 3-5x more expensive. |
| **Reddit** | ? | Good | Low–Medium | Subreddit-based targeting. Cheap CPCs. Unforgiving — bad ads get roasted. |
| **YouTube** | ? | Good | Medium | Interest, topic, influencer targeting. Good for demo-heavy products. |
| **X/Twitter** | ? | Medium | Medium | Follower targeting, keywords, interests. Strong for tech/startup audiences. |
| **Facebook** | ? | Good | Medium–High | Interests, behaviours, lookalikes. Best for SMB/prosumer audiences. |
| **Instagram** | ? | Good | Medium–High | Visual-first. Better for B2C adjacent products. |
| **TikTok** | ? | Limited | Medium | Age and interest targeting. Weak for most B2B. |

Fill in **Concentration** based on the target market. The ideal platform scores High + Excellent + Low.

**For organic channels:**
- Check if competitors have active presence (blog, social accounts, YouTube channel)
- Assess content gap opportunities
- Estimate content velocity needed

**For outbound:**
- Check if target buyers are reachable (LinkedIn presence, email findability)
- Assess message-market fit potential

### Step 5: Score and Rank Channels

Score each viable channel on 5 criteria (1-5 each):

| Criteria | What to evaluate |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Audience fit** | How well does this channel reach your specific target market? |
| **Speed to results** | How quickly can you get meaningful data or customers? |
| **Cost efficiency** | What's the expected cost per lead/customer relative to your budget and ACV? |
| **Effort to execute** | How much time, skill, and ongoing maintenance is required? |
| **Learning value** | Will this channel teach you things that transfer to other channels? |

Rank by total score. For ties, break with:
1. Speed to results (early-stage needs fast feedback loops)
2. Learning value (insights compound across channels)
3. Cost efficiency (preserve runway)

**Fast-feedback principle for early-stage founders:** Prioritize channels that return meaningful signal within 48 hours. Three channels qualify: paid ads, community participation (Reddit, Slack, forums), and direct outreach (cold email, DMs). SEO, content marketing, video, and podcasting all take months to spin up. Prove the fast-feedback channels work first.

### Step 6: Build Channel Recommendations

For the top 3 recommended channels, produce a recommendation with:
- Why this channel fits the target market
- What to do first (concrete next step)
- Expected timeline to meaningful results
- Budget estimate (if paid)
- What success looks like

## Rules

- Recommend 1-2 channels to nail first, with a 3rd as a backup. "Try everything" is bad advice for early-stage.
- Paid channels are faster for validation but burn cash. Organic channels compound but take months. Match the recommendation to the founder's stage and constraints.
- Don't recommend channels just because they're popular. A plumber doesn't need TikTok. A dev tools founder doesn't need Facebook Ads. Match the channel to the market.
- If the founder has already tried channels, ask what happened. Failed channels often failed due to execution, not fit.
- If Step 2b is hard to answer, either you don't know enough about the customer yet, or the segment is too broad. Push for specificity first.
