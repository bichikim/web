# Needle MCP Server & Search API Reference

Two ways to reach Needle's knowledge base and tooling from an agent:

1. **Needle MCP Server** — full tool set (docs search, project files, live scene inspection). Requires setup.
2. **Search HTTP API** — docs search only, no setup, works from any shell with `curl`.

Prefer MCP when it's connected. Fall back to the HTTP API when it isn't.

---

## Search HTTP API

Public endpoint at `https://search.needle.tools`. Indexes Needle Engine documentation, the API reference, the community forum, Discord, and Needle source code. No API key needed.

Full reference, including endpoints not covered here: **https://search.needle.tools/api-docs**

### Semantic search

```bash
curl -s -H "Accept: application/json" \
  "https://search.needle.tools/api/semantic-search?q=how+to+add+a+rigidbody&limit=5"
```

Embedding-ranked results with content — no LLM in the loop, so it's fast and returns the source text verbatim.

| Parameter   | Default | Range     | Description                                                           |
| ----------- | ------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `q`         | —       | required  | The query. Full natural-language questions work better than keywords. |
| `limit`     | `10`    | 1–20      | Number of results.                                                    |
| `max_chars` | `2000`  | 200–10000 | Max characters of content per result.                                 |

Response:

```json
{
  "query": "how to add a rigidbody",
  "results": [
    {
      "type": "message",
      "score": 0.94,
      "title": "Needle Engine Docs",
      "source": "Needle Engine Docs",
      "content": "## Rigidbodies\n\nRigidbodies add physics simulation to objects...",
      "contentLength": 750,
      "truncated": true,
      "url": "https://engine.needle.tools/docs/how-to-guides/scripting/use-physics.html#:~:text=...",
      "timestamp": "2026-03-05T14:57:40.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "durationMs": 2828
}
```

`url` carries a `#:~:text=` text fragment pointing at the exact passage — pass it through to the user so they can jump straight to it. When `truncated` is `true`, re-request with a higher `max_chars` or open the `url`.

### Ask (LLM answer with sources)

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://search.needle.tools/api/ask" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "how do I sync a transform in multiplayer?"}'
```

Returns `{ answer, sources, usage }`. Optional `messages` array for follow-up turns. Send `Accept: text/event-stream` to stream.

Prefer `/api/semantic-search` when you're the one reasoning over the results — you get the raw source material without a second model's summary in between.

### Limits & auth

- Unauthenticated: **10 requests/minute per IP**. Exceeding it returns `429` with a `Retry-After` header.
- A Bearer token lifts the rate limit: `-H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"`.
- `GET /api/v1/search` is deprecated — it 301-redirects to `/api/semantic-search`. Don't write new code against it.

### Plain-markdown docs

Any documentation page is available as markdown — swap `.html` for `.md`:

```
https://engine.needle.tools/docs/how-to-guides/scripting/use-physics.md
```

Whole-corpus context files: [llms.txt](https://cloud.needle.tools/llms.txt) (compact) and [llms-full.txt](https://cloud.needle.tools/llms-full.txt) (complete).

## Needle MCP Server

Ships with the `needle-cloud` npm package. Two connection modes, same tools:

```bash
npx needle-cloud mcp      # stdio — the client spawns the process
npx needle-cloud start    # local HTTP server on localhost:8424
```

Use the local HTTP server when you also want live scene access — the Needle Inspector and the Unity/Blender integrations connect to it. If Needle Engine for Unity or Blender is running, that server is usually already up.

Client config for stdio mode:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "needle": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "needle-cloud", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

For HTTP mode, point the client at `http://localhost:8424/mcp` with transport `http`. Per-client setup instructions (Claude Desktop, Codex CLI, VS Code, Cursor, Antigravity) are at https://engine.needle.tools/docs/ai/needle-mcp-server.

### Always-available tools

| Tool                        | What it does                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `needle_search`             | Semantic search over docs, forum, Discord, and source. Same corpus as the HTTP API.                     |
| `load_needle_engine_skill`  | Loads this skill's guidelines and API references.                                                       |
| `needle_cloud_me`           | Current Needle Cloud user and team.                                                                     |
| `files_editor_project_path` | Path to the open Unity or Blender project.                                                              |
| `files_editor_scene_path`   | Path to the open scene.                                                                                 |
| `files_web_project_path`    | Path to the Needle Engine web project directory.                                                        |
| `files_editor_log_path`     | Path to the Unity/Blender editor log.                                                                   |
| `files_read`                | Read a file from the editor or web project, with line range and text filter.                            |
| `files_grep`                | Regex search across project files, with glob and result limit.                                          |
| `files_list`                | List project files by glob, optionally recursive.                                                       |
| `files_read_editor_log`     | Read or keyword-search the editor log.                                                                  |
| `files_read_gltf`           | Summarize a glTF/GLB — nodes, meshes, materials, animations, extensions. Supports JSON pointer queries. |

`files_*` tools resolve paths relative to the editor and web projects the server knows about, so they work even when the agent's working directory is somewhere else. `files_read_gltf` beats reading a `.glb` as bytes — use it to answer "what's actually in this scene file".

### Live scene tools (Needle Inspector)

Available when the [Needle Inspector](https://engine.needle.tools/docs/three/needle-devtools-for-threejs-chrome-extension) Chrome extension is open on a running page and connected to the local server. These act on the **live scene in the browser** — reads reflect current runtime state, and `inspector_property_setValue` changes appear instantly.

| Tool                                                                                                | What it does                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inspector_hierarchy_search_nodes`                                                                  | Find objects in the live scene graph by name or type.                           |
| `inspector_hierarchy_select_node`                                                                   | Select an object (also drives the Inspector UI).                                |
| `inspector_get_selected_object`                                                                     | Read the current selection.                                                     |
| `inspector_component_search`                                                                        | Find components in the running scene.                                           |
| `inspector_property_find` / `inspector_property_read`                                               | Locate and read properties on objects, components, and materials.               |
| `inspector_property_setValue`                                                                       | Write a property — applied live.                                                |
| `inspector_get_edits`                                                                               | Pull edits made by hand in the Inspector, so you can apply them to source code. |
| `inspector_actions_property_whoCalls`                                                               | Trace what code writes a given property.                                        |
| `inspector_code_read`                                                                               | Read the page's loaded source.                                                  |
| `inspector_console_read`                                                                            | Read the browser console.                                                       |
| `inspector_gltf_read` / `inspector_nodegraph_read`                                                  | Inspect loaded glTF assets and node graphs.                                     |
| `inspector_assets_search_asset` / `inspector_assets_read_details` / `inspector_assets_read_options` | Search and inspect assets.                                                      |
| `inspector_resources_list` / `inspector_get_website_resource_info`                                  | Enumerate loaded resources and their sizes.                                     |
| `inspector_measure_website_performance` / `inspector_gpu_timing_profile`                            | Measure runtime and GPU performance.                                            |
| `inspector_get_current_website` / `inspector_fetch_website` / `inspector_read_website_content`      | Read the current page or fetch another.                                         |
| `inspector_open_external_resource`                                                                  | Open a resource externally.                                                     |
| `inspector_get_current_time`                                                                        | Current time from the Inspector's context.                                      |

The `inspector_get_edits` → apply-to-source loop is the high-value one: the user tweaks a material or transform in the browser, you read the edits and make them permanent in the project files.

> MCP/AI editing via the Inspector requires **Needle Inspector Pro** (one-time purchase, included with Needle Engine Pro). Read-only docs search and `files_*` tools do not.

### Unity tools

| Tool                         | What it does                      |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `unity_get_selected_objects` | Read the current Unity selection. |

### Blender tools

Registered by the [Needle Blender add-on](https://engine.needle.tools/docs/blender/) when it's running. These act on the **live Blender session** — writes show up in the viewport immediately.

| Tool                             | What it does                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blender_search_hierarchy`       | Return the scene hierarchy tree — names, types, parent/child relationships. Filter by name pattern or object type.                       |
| `blender_get_object_details`     | Detail for one object by name: transform, mesh stats, materials with shader info, modifiers, constraints, visibility, Needle components. |
| `blender_get_selected_objects`   | Current selection — names, types, optionally full details.                                                                               |
| `blender_select_object`          | Select one or more objects by name; optionally deselect others and set the active object.                                                |
| `blender_add_component`          | Add a Needle component to an object, optionally with initial property values.                                                            |
| `blender_set_component_property` | Set properties on a component that already exists and is active on the object.                                                           |
| `blender_set_object_transform`   | Set position/rotation/scale. Only provided fields change.                                                                                |
| `blender_get_scene_settings`     | Read Needle scene settings as flat key/value pairs using Blender property names.                                                         |
| `blender_set_scene_settings`     | Write scene settings. Call `blender_get_scene_settings` first to see current values.                                                     |

Scene settings matter more than they look: they control which components are **implicitly added during export** (compression, XR, networking, rendering). If an exported GLB has components nobody authored, check these.
